# API Regression Testing
## ðŸ“Œ About this collection

This collection helps ensure your API continues to work as expected after updates or changes. It contains sample requests for a series of tests that validate different aspects of an API, including:

1.  **Status code verification:** We'll check if the API returns the expected status codes for various requests, ensuring reliability and proper error handling.
2.  **JSON schema verification:** We'll make sure the JSON response conforms to a specified JSON Schema, ensuring API contracts are honored.
3.  **Response time verification:** We'll verify that the API's response time is within the acceptable range, providing a smooth user experience and optimizing performance.
4.  **Response body verification:** We'll validate the structure and content of the response body for accuracy, ensuring the integrity of the data and preventing potential issues downstream.
5.  **Header verification:** We'll confirm the presence and correct values of specific headers in the response, enabling secure and well-structured communication between your app and its users.
